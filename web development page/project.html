    <p>Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ;[a] derived from a shortening of English animation) is a hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan.<br/> Outside
         Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.<br/>[1] However, anime, in Japan and in Japanese, describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin.
          <br/>Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. <br/>Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that are 
          sometimes labelled as anime.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. <br/>A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in the following 
        decades, developing a large domestic audience.<br/> Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original 
        works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games.<br/> It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.[2]</p>

        <p>Whey are those tears in your eyes, my child?<br/>
            How horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing!<br/>
            You have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing-
            is that why they call you dirty?<br/>
            O, fie! Would they dare to call the full moon dirty because<br/>
            it has smudged its face with ink?<br/>
            For every little trifle they blame you, my child. They are
            ready to find fault for nothing.<br/>
            You tore your clothes while playing-is that why they call you
            untidy?<br/>
            O, fie! What would they call an autumn morning that smiles
            through its ragged clouds?<br/>
            Take no heed of what they say to you, my child.
            They make a long list of your misdeeds.<br/>
            Everybody knows how you love sweet things-is that why they
            call you greedy?<br/>
            O, fie! What then would they call us who love you?</p>
